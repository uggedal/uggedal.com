% Deduplicated Backup Comparison
% draft

I've been on lookup for a fully open source alternative since Tarsnap
popularized deduplicateted backups. I've compared the efficiency
(storage and bandwidth), performance, security and utility of
the main offerings. I'm ignoring what should be every backup system's
most important quality: stability and correctness.

TODO: peak memory usage (maybe GNU time)
TODO: measure restore also
TODO: measure without and with network where applicable
TODO: measure without and with crupto where applicable
TODO: clear caches before each run
TODO: compare backup without changes
TODO: compare stable and master versions
TODO: compare obnam experimental format
